Dearest reader.

I'm [Mads Bram Cordes](https://madco.me), from [1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993) and a full-stack developer. Some times I prefer the back-end. Not that this has ever been holding me back from building a lovable front-end.

My preferred stack [`Go`](https://golang.org) as the back-, and [`Svelte`](https://svelte.dev/) or [`React`](https://reactjs.org/) as the front-end. Though, I'm always interested in learning about new languages. In my spare-time I sometimes study the magnificent language called [`V`](https://vlang.io/). Otherwise, whatever that pop-ups on my screen that I can see as a way to challenge myself. Be it the deadly arts of dev-ops or a debugging adventure of code. Thou shall not fall alone!

To get me in my comfort zone, I'd love an ANSI American layout along with the necessary [60% keys](https://en.akkogear.com/product/silent-3068-bt-5-0white-led-mechanical-keyboard/). Throw in a couple of great funky rhymes, rocking tunes and a couple of moniters, and I'm there! Slowly but steadily, and I won't ever leave again!

I'm always open for other people asking me, if they're in need of something - anything at all, from a problem regarding codes, to a cup of coffee or some big questions about life itself.

I'd love to work a Fleks-job, preferably around the 16 hours a week along with a day off. Meaning I'd be able to work for four hours, four days a week. Though, if these hours/days won't fit your busy schedule. I'm able to change them, both from week-to-week and - sometimes - day-to-day.

If the job is very well suited for me, and I'm in my comfort zone, I'd love to give more hours a try!

Have a nerd-tastic day!

Best, [Mads Bram Cordes](https://madco.me)
