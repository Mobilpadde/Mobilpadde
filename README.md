I'm [Mads](https://madco.me), from [1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993) and a full-stack developer. Some times I prefer only working on the back-end, other times I love me a good visual feedback loop 🎉

My preferred stack [`Go`](https://golang.org) as the back-, and [`Svelte(kit)`](https://svelte.dev/) or [`React`](https://reactjs.org/) as the front-end. Though, I'm always interested in learning about new languages. In my spare-time I sometimes study the magnificent language called [`V`](https://vlang.io/). Otherwise, whatever that pop-ups on my screen that I can see as a way to challenge myself. Be it the deadly arts of dev-ops or a debugging adventure of code. Thou shall not fall alone! 🧑‍💻

To get me in my comfort zone, I'd love an ANSI American layout along with the necessary 60% keys ⌨️ Throw in a couple of great funky rhymes, rocking tunes and a couple of moniters, and I'm there 🎧 Slowly but steadily, and I won't ever leave again! 🫣

I'm always open for other people asking me, if they're in need of something - anything at all, from a problem regarding codes, to a cup of coffee or some big questions about life itself 🫂

Have a nerd-tastic day! 🫡
